# Pneumonia Classification using X-Ray Images

## Overview

This repository contains a project that classifies pneumonia using X-ray images. The model leverages transfer learning techniques and is saved as `trained_model.h5`. This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient way to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays, aiding in the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that can be life-threatening, especially in children and the elderly. Early detection through chest X-rays can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project uses a deep learning model based on transfer learning to classify X-ray images as either showing pneumonia or being normal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) available on Kaggle. It consists of 5,863 X-ray images categorized into two classes:
- Normal
- Pneumonia

## Model

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on a pre-trained network (such as VGG16, ResNet50, etc.) using transfer learning. The final trained model is saved as `trained_model.h5`.

### Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes a pre-trained model to leverage existing knowledge and improve accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the dataset by applying random transformations to improve model generalization.
- **Performance**: Achieves high accuracy in classifying X-ray images.

## Installation
